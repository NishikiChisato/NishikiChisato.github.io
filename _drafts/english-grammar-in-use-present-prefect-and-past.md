# Present perfect 1 (I have done)

## Part 7A

Tom can't find his key. He**'s lost** his key. (= he **has lost**...)

He **has lost** his key = he lost it and he donesn't have it now. (**have lost**/**has lost** is the *present perfect simple*)

||||
|-|-|-|
|I/we/they/you|**have** (= I**'ve** etc.)|**finished**/**lost**|
|he/she/it|**has** (= he**'s** etc.)|**done**/**been**|

The *present perfect simple* is **have**/**has** + *past participle*. The *past participle* often ends in -**ed**, but many verbs are *irregular*.

## Part 7B

When we say 'something **has happened**', this is usually new information:
- Ow! I**'ve cut** my finger.
- The road is closed. There**'s been** an accident. (= There **has been**)
- Police **have arrested** two men in connection with the robbery.

When we use the *present perfect*, there is a connection with *now*. The action in the past has a result *now*:
- Tom **has lost** his key. (= he doesn't have it *now*)
- He told me his name, but I**'ve forgotten** it. (= Ican't remember it *now*)
- Sally is still here. She **hasn't gone** out. (= she is here *now*)
- I can't find my bag. **have** you **seen** it? (= do you know where it is *now*)

Compare **gone** (**to**) and **been** (**to**):
- James is on holiday. He **has gone to** Italy. (= he is there *now* or on his way there)
- Amy is back home now. She **has been** to Italy. (= she has *now* come back)
- Hello! I**'ve just been to** the shop. I've bought lot of things. (= I have *now* come back)
- Tom **has just gone** out. He'll be back in about an hour. (= he is out *now* or on his way out)
- Alice isn't here at the monent. I don't know where she**'s gone**. (= she isn't here *now*)
- You're very late. Where **have you been**? (= I have come back *now*)

## Part 7C

We can use the *present perfect* with **just**, **already** and **yet**.

**Just** = a short time ago:
- 'Are you hungry?'; 'No, I**'ve just had** lunch.'
- Hello. **Have** you **just arrived**?

**Already** = sooner than expected:
- 'Don't forget to pay the bill.'; 'I**'ve already paid** it'
- 'What time is Mark leaving?'; 'He**'s already left**.'

**Yet** = unitl now. We use **yet** to show that **we are expecting something to happen**.
- **Has** it **stopped** raining **yet**?
- I've written the email, but I **haven't sent** it **yet**.

## Part 7D

Basically, we can use *past simple* to represent *present perfect simple*:
- Ben isn't here. He**'s gone** out. *or* He **went** out.
- 'Are you hungry?'; 'No, I**'ve just had** lunch.' *or* 'No, I **just had** lunch
- I can't find my bag. **Have you seen** it anywhere? *or* **Did you see** it anywhere?
- I sent joe an email this morning, but **he hasn't replied**. *or* he **didn't reply**.
