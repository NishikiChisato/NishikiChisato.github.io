# Present and Past

# Present Continuous

**am/is/are + -ing** is *present continuous*.

I am driving -> I'm driving now, **at the time of speaking**. And the action is not finished.
He is working -> He's working now, at the time of speaking. And the action is not finished.

I am doing something = **I started doing it and I haven't finished; I'm in the middle of doing it**.
- Please don't make so much noise. I**'m trying** to work. (*not* I try)
- 'Where's Mark?'   'He's having a shower'. (*not* He has a shower)
- Let's go out now. It isn't raining any more. (*not* It doesn't rain)

Sometimes the action is not happening at the time of speaking. For example:
- Kate wants to work in Italy, so she**'s learning** Italian. (but perhaps she isn't learning Italian at the time of speaking)
- Some friends of mine **are building** their own house. They hope to finish it next summer. (again, they aren't building at the time of speaking)

You can use the *present continuous* with **today** / **this week** / **this year** etc. (periods around now):
- You**'re working** hard **today**. (*not* You work hard today)
- The company I work for **isn't doing** so well **this year**.

We use *present continuous* when we talk about **a change that has started to happen**. We often use these verbs in this way:
- **getting**, **becoming**, **changing**, **improving**, **starting**, **beginning**, **increasing**, **rising**, **falling**, **growing**
  - Is your English getting better? (*not* Does your English get better)
  - The population of the world **is Increasing** very fast. (*not* increases)
  - At first I didn't like my job, but I**'m starting** to enjoy it now. (not I start)
